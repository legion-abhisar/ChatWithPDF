---
This is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM project that helps in getting insights from a PDF file via a Question and Answer based format, where the user can upload a PDF and then ask question based on the PDF and the LLM presents with the best possible answer that the user seeks.

Tech: Langchain, Ollama (Mistral:7b), FAISS, Streamlit

LLM Server (Ollama) -> Langchain + FAISS (RAG Framework) -> Streamlit (User Interface)
